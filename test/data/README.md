# VISTA hierarchy upload fixtures

The `PT1/` directory contains test upload images sourced from the Hugging Face dataset
`Ryukijano/Pothole-detection-Yolov8`, starting with the upstream image whose
filename begins with `0001`.

The files are renamed into the VISTA inspection hierarchy format:

```text
design_number_lot_number_set_number_serial_number_side_modality_overlay.jpg
```

Example:

```text
D1001_LOT01_SET01_SN0001_front_visual_false.jpg
```

The PT1 Load Test Data flow reads `PT1/regex.txt` and applies it while
recursively loading files from `test/data/PT1`, matching the regular filename
metadata extraction path. When these files are selected in the image uploader,
the filename metadata extractor should auto-apply the delimiter `_` with keys:

```text
design_number, lot_number, set_number, serial_number, side, modality, overlay
```

The upload flow then posts the raw images and creates inspection parts named by
design, lot, set, and serial number. These fixtures do not assign parts to
inspection batches; `batch_number` remains available for filenames that should
create internal VISTA batch groupings.


Additional `PT1/*_segmentation_true.txt` files are compact text overlay fixtures loaded by
the PT1 and PT2 Load Test Data flows alongside the existing visual and heatmap
modalities.
