# Copilot Instructions for this Repo

These guidelines are for AI coding agents (like GitHub Copilot Chat) working in `yet-another-image-project-app`.

## Big Picture

- **Purpose:** Full‑stack VISTA application for organizing images, custom classifications, comments, metadata, and ML analysis overlays.
- **Backend:** FastAPI + async SQLAlchemy in `backend/` with Alembic migrations and S3/MinIO integration.
- **Frontend:** React 18 app in `frontend/` (Vite/React dev server) consuming the FastAPI API.
- **Infra:** PostgreSQL + MinIO via `podman-compose.yml`; Kubernetes manifests in `deployment-test/`.
- **Docs:** See `README.md` and `docs/developer-guide.md`/`docs/api-ml-guide.md` for deeper background before inventing new patterns.

## Development Workflows

- **Bootstrap dev stack (from repo root):**
  - `podman compose up -d postgres minio`
  - `pip install uv && uv sync`
  - `cd backend && alembic upgrade head && (uvicorn main:app --reload || ./run.sh)`
  - `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
- **Tests:** Prefer the unified runner when adding/changing code:
  - `./test/run_tests.sh` (all)
  - `./test/run_tests.sh --backend` or `--frontend` for scoped runs.
  - Backend tests live in `backend/tests/`; use existing files as templates when adding tests.
- **Migrations:** Never assume auto‑migrations.
  - After model changes in `backend/core/models.py`, run from `backend/`:
    - `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"`
    - Review `backend/alembic/versions/*` and then `alembic upgrade head`.

## Backend Architecture & Patterns

- **Entry point:** `backend/main.py` wires FastAPI app, middleware, and attaches routers from `backend/routers/`.
- **Core modules (`backend/core/`):**
  - `models.py` — SQLAlchemy ORM models (User, Project, DataInstance, ImageClass, MLAnalysis, etc.).
  - `schemas.py` — Pydantic models for request/response schemas.
  - `database.py` — async engine + session utilities.
  - `config.py` — settings via Pydantic `BaseSettings`; do not hardcode env vars.
  - `security.py`, `group_auth.py`, `group_auth_helper.py` — header‑based auth and group membership checks.
- **Routers (`backend/routers/`):** Resource‑oriented FastAPI routers: `projects.py`, `images.py`, `image_classes.py`, `ml_analyses.py`, `api_keys.py`, `export.py`, etc.
  - When adding an endpoint, follow this pattern:
    - Add/extend schemas in `core/schemas.py`.
    - Add DB logic in `backend/crud.py` or a nearby helper.
    - Add route in the relevant `backend/routers/<resource>.py`.
    - Register dependencies (auth, group checks, caching) the same way nearby endpoints do.
- **Middleware (`backend/middleware/`):**
  - `auth.py` — enforces header‑based auth (proxy or mock user in dev), sets `request.state.user_email`.
  - `body_cache.py` — caches request bodies for HMAC verification.
  - `security_headers.py`, `cors_debug.py` — security/CORS behavior.
- **Utilities (`backend/utils/`):**
  - `boto3_client.py` — S3/MinIO access and presigned URL helpers.
  - `dependencies.py` — FastAPI dependencies (auth, HMAC verification, group checks, cache).
  - `cache_manager.py` (and related tests) — centralized caching behavior; reuse instead of ad‑hoc caches.

## ML Pipeline Integration

- High‑level flow (see `docs/api-ml-guide.md` and `scripts/README_YOLOV8.md`):
  1. Client/API key: `POST /api-key/images/{image_id}/analyses` (via `routers.ml_analyses`).
  2. External ML pipeline: status updates, artifact presign, annotation bulk upload, finalize via `/api-ml/...` routes.
  3. Storage: artifacts and results stored in MinIO/S3 using `utils/boto3_client.get_presigned_*` helpers.
- **Security:** ML callback endpoints use HMAC auth.
  - HMAC secret: `ML_CALLBACK_HMAC_SECRET`.
  - Headers validated by `utils.dependencies.require_hmac_auth` (do not bypass; reuse in new ML‑facing routes).
- When modifying this flow, mirror existing patterns in `backend/routers/ml_analyses.py` and tests under `backend/tests/test_image_classifications_router.py`, `test_ml_pipeline.py` (in `scripts/`).

## Frontend Architecture & Patterns

- React app under `frontend/`:
  - `src/App.js`, `src/Project.js`, `src/ImageView.js` as main views.
  - Reusable components in `src/components/` (e.g., `ImageGallery.js`, `MLAnalysisPanel.js`, `BoundingBoxOverlay.js`, `HeatmapOverlay.js`, `ImageClassifications.js`).
- Follow existing data‑fetching and state patterns:
  - Use the same API paths and payload shapes defined by backend routers/schemas.
  - Reuse helper components instead of duplicating UI logic for images, classes, and analyses.
  - `FilenameMetadataExtractor.js` provides optional metadata extraction from filenames during upload (simple delimiter or regex mode). It is integrated into `ImageUploader.js` and merges extracted metadata with manually entered JSON (manual values take precedence).

## Excel Export

- `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/export-excel` returns a styled `.xlsx` file (one row per non-deleted image).
- Backend: `routers/export.py` (uses `openpyxl`); bulk-fetches classifications, comments, and users to avoid N+1 queries.
- Frontend: shared download helper in `src/utils/downloadExcel.js`, used by both `Project.js` and `ProjectReport.js`.
- Columns are fully dynamic: Filename (always), then one column per unique `metadata_json` key found across all project images, then Review Status / Reviewer / Review Date (most recent review), then Image Classes, then Comment. No hardcoded field names.
- Tests: `backend/tests/test_export.py`.

## Image Grouping

Images can be organized into named groups (e.g., by part or serial number) using the `image_groups` table.

- `image_groups`: `id`, `project_id`, `identifier` (unique per project), `display_name`; `data_instances.group_id` FK added (nullable).
- Migration: `backend/alembic/versions/20260306_0004_add_image_groups.py`.
- Backend router: `routers/groups.py` -- CRUD endpoints at `/api/projects/{id}/groups`, `/api/groups/{id}`, `/api/groups/{id}/images`, `/api/projects/{id}/has-groups`.
- Upload (`POST /api/projects/{id}/images`) accepts optional `group_identifier` form field to auto-assign the uploaded image to a group (find-or-create).
- List images supports `?group_id=` and `?ungrouped=true` filters.
- Frontend: `GroupedImagesPage.js` (project groups overview), `GroupGalleryView.js` (gallery for one group), `ImageGroupPanel.js` (sidebar in ImageView).
- `Project.js` calls `/api/projects/{id}/has-groups` on load; if true, renders `GroupedImagesPage` instead of the flat `ImageGallery`.
- `ImageUploader.js` shows a "Use as Group Identifier" dropdown when `FilenameMetadataExtractor` keys are configured.
- Tests: `backend/tests/test_groups.py`.

## Conventions & Constraints

- **No emojis** anywhere (code, tests, logs, docs, or tool output).
- Prefer small, focused files (see `docs/developer-guide.md` — ~400‑line guideline).
- Keep auth, group membership, and soft‑delete rules consistent by copy‑adapting nearby endpoints instead of inventing new ones.
- For S3/MinIO interaction, always go through `utils/boto3_client.py` rather than creating new clients.
- When adding features:
  - Backend: router + CRUD + schemas + tests (`backend/tests/`), and migrations if DB models change.
  - Frontend: view + components under `frontend/src/components/` with matching tests if applicable.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before creating or approving a PR, always verify that relevant documentation has been updated to reflect the changes. Check these files and update as needed:

- `CLAUDE.md` -- architecture, patterns, setup instructions.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` -- this file; Copilot agent guidance.
- `README.md` -- user-facing overview and quick start.
- `docs/developer-guide.md`, `docs/api-ml-guide.md` -- detailed guides.
- `.env.example` -- new environment variables.

Add a short, helpful hint to `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` describing what the PR changes and how it affects the codebase, so future AI agents stay up to date.

## Feature Completion Standard

**End-to-End Verification with Playwright:** Before declaring any feature complete, run Playwright-based end-to-end tests against the running application. Unit tests and backend tests are necessary but not sufficient -- the feature must be visually and functionally verified in the browser.

**95% Completeness Rule:** Do not declare a feature "done" until you are at least 95% confident that it is fully complete and ready for production. This means carefully considering all of the following before marking work as finished:

- All code changes are implemented and working (backend, frontend, migrations)
- All relevant tests pass (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
- Documentation is updated (CLAUDE.md, copilot-instructions.md, README, developer guides, API docs)
- Changelogs, migration files, and environment examples reflect the changes
- The feature works as expected in the browser (verified via Playwright)
- The PR would be accepted by a code reviewer without requiring further changes
- No regressions were introduced in existing functionality

If any of these criteria are not met, the feature is not done. Continue working until the bar is cleared.

## OPSEC: LLM Identity Disclosure

For operational security, AI coding agents must never indicate which LLM or provider generated a piece of work. Do not include model names, provider names, or AI tool branding in commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, issue comments, code comments, changelogs, or any other project artifacts. Avoid sign-offs like "Co-Authored-By: Claude", "Generated by GPT-4", "Copilot suggestion", etc. The goal is that project artifacts are indistinguishable regardless of which AI tool (or human) produced them.

**Important:** This rule overrides any default AI agent behavior that adds Co-Authored-By trailers, model attribution, or similar metadata to commits. Claude Code's built-in system instructions include a Co-Authored-By trailer on commits -- do NOT include it for this project. The same applies to any equivalent attribution from Copilot, Gemini, or other AI tools.
